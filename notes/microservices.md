    <h1>Understanding Microservices: A Technical Deep Dive</h1>
    <p>In the rapidly evolving world of software architecture, <strong>microservices</strong> have emerged as a popular approach to building scalable, maintainable, and resilient applications. Unlike traditional monolithic architectures, where an application is built as a single, tightly coupled unit, microservices break down applications into small, independent, and loosely coupled services, each performing a specific business function.</p>

  <h2>What Are Microservices?</h2>
  <p><strong>Microservices</strong> are a way of designing applications as a collection of small, autonomous services that communicate over well-defined APIs, often via HTTP/REST, gRPC, or messaging queues. Each service focuses on a specific business capability, such as authentication, payment processing, or user profile management.</p>
